Input file formatting:
	credentials.txt is a one-line file containing the personal API token of a Hipchat account.
	hist.txt, host.txt, and pmUser.txt are all one-line files containing the target URL for a given REST call
	currently, pmUser.txt is the only one in use in this project, as private messaging is the only function
	being used.
